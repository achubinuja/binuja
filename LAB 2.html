		 <h2>LATEST UPDATES</h2>
		 <h2 > <mark><i>OMICRON</i></mark></h2></a>
	  	<p><b> Omicron</b> and its subvariants have ranked as the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains in the U.S. for almost two years now. While the original Omicron strain (BA.1) is no longer circulating, Omicron subvariants are now driving most of the country’s SARS-CoV-2 infections. Omicron was first identified in Botswana and South Africa in late November 2021, and cases quickly began to surface and multiply in other countries. By December of that year, Omicron was causing daily case numbers in the U.S. to skyrocket to over a million. In 2022, it had spawned a number of subvariants. In 2023, a new Omicron strain called EG.5 (nicknamed “Eris”) is the dominant strain in the U.S., and experts are monitoring another new strain called BA.2.86 (nicknamed “Pirola”).</p>
	  
      <h2> <mark><i>DELTA</i></mark></h2>
      <p><b>Delta</b> was first identified in India in late 2020; it soon spread throughout the world, becoming what was the predominant version of the coronavirus—until Omicron took its place in mid-December of 2021.
      How contagious is it? It’s estimated that Delta caused more than twice as many infections as previous variants—in Connecticut, it was estimated to have been 80 to 90% more transmissible than the Alpha variant. In the U.S., in June 2021, after a steady decline in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, the arrival of Delta coincided with a rapid reversal of that trend. In the fall of 2021, there were surges even in the most vaccinated states, prompting experts to urge people to get their booster shots.</p></div>

       <h2><mark>PROGRESS OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE EFFORT</mark></h2>
       	The efficacies for<b> COVID-19 </b>vaccines shown in Table 1 were calculated from clinical trials based on defined end points (which can differ between trials, even in terms of the definition of symptomatic disease). These values are important for the approval of vaccines, but they do not necessarily reflect the impact of vaccination in the real world, especially when clinical trials for vaccines have enrolled mostly younger, healthy adults compared to those most at risk of severe disease, and these trials occurred in the absence of some of the more recently reported SARS-CoV-2 variants. It is therefore important to understand the extent and duration of protection against infection or disease in all age groups and populations; in the case of<b> COVID-19</b>, this is particularly important given the higher risk of severe disease in older individuals (70 years of age and older). Vaccine effectiveness, which differs from vaccine efficacy, is the reduced risk of infection or disease among vaccinated individuals. This can be impacted by population-dependent effects of the vaccine as well as vaccination schedules and handling/administration of vaccines.</p>

      	<h2><i> <mark>GLOBAL RESPONSE </mark></i></h2>
       	<p>More than thirty vaccines have been approved for general or emergency use in countries around the world. By the end of 2022, over thirteen billion doses had been administered worldwide. In dozens ofcountries, at least three-quarters of the population has been fully vaccinated; Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are among those with the highest immunization rates. However, many others—mostly in Africa—have vaccinated only small fractions of their populations. Close to three years after COVID-19 emerged, nearly one-third of the global population is yet to receive a vaccine dose</p></div>
